    abstract = {{In the last five years we have witnessed a significant increase in the number publications describing accurate and reliable all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of nucleic acids. This increase has been facilitated by the development of fast and efficient methods for treating the long-range electrostatic interactions, the availability of faster parallel computers, and the development of well-validated empirical molecular mechanical force fields. With these technologies, it has been demonstrated that simulation is not only capable of consistently reproducing experimental observations of sequence specific fine structure of DNA, but also can give detailed insight into prevalent problems in nucleic acid structure, ion association and specific hydration of nucleic acids, polyadenine tract bending, and the subtle environmental dependence of the A-DNA–B-DNA duplex equilibrium. Despite the advances, there are still issues with the methods that need to be resolved through rigorous controlled testing. In general, these relate to deficiencies of the underlying molecular mechanical potentials or applied methods (such as the imposition of true periodicity in Ewald simulations and the need for energy conservation), and significant limits in effective conformational sampling. In this perspective, we provide an overview of our experiences, provide some cautionary notes, and provide recommendations for further study in molecular dynamics simulation of nucleic acids. {\copyright} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

    abstract = {{Ions are a ubiquitous component of the cellular environment, transferring into cells through membrane-embedded proteins. Ions bind to proteins to regulate their charge and function. Here, using multiconformation continuum electrostatics (MCCE), we show that the changes of chloride binding to alpha-amylase, human serum albumin (HSA) and Omp32 with pH, and of alpha-amylase with mutation agree well with experimental data. The three proteins represent three different types of binding. In alpha-amylase, chloride is bound in a specific buried site. Chloride binding is strongly coupled to the protonation state of a nearby lysine. MCCE calculates an 11-fold change in chloride affinity between the wild-type alpha-amylase and the K300R mutant, in good agreement with the measured 10-fold change.Without considering the coupled protonation reaction, the calculated affinity change would be more than 10(6)-fold. In HSA, chlorides are distributed on the protein surface. Although HSA has a negative net charge, it binds more anions than cations. There are no highly occupied binding sites in HSA. Rather, there are many partially occupied sites near clusters of basic residues. The relative affinity of bound ions of different charges is shown to depend on the distribution of charged residues on the surface rather than the overall net charge of the protein. The calculated strong pH dependence of the number of chlorides bound and the anion selectivity agree with those of previous experiments. In Omp32, chlorides are stabilized in an anion-selective transmembrane channel in a pH-independent manner. The positive electrostatic potential in Omp32 results in about two chlorides and no cations bound in the transmembrane region of this anion-selective channel. The studies here show that with the ability to sample multiple binding sites and coupled protein protonation states, MCCE provides a powerful tool to analyze and predict ion binding. The calculations overestimate the affinity of surface chloride in HSA and Omp32 relative to the buried ion in amylase. Differences between ion-solvent interactions for buried and surface ions will be discussed.}},

Although molecular dynamics simulations have been applied on various nucleic acids, accurate and efficient descriptions of ion motions around DNA or RNA are still challenging, largely due to ions' slow mobility. Here, a variant Hamiltonian replica exchange method was developed to achieve efficient sampling of ion motions. Based on the present approach, the results from our model study on classical Drew–Dickerson B-DNA dodecamer show remarkable agreements with experimental measurements and nonlinear Poisson–Boltzmann predictions. Due to the employment of this variant Hamiltonian replica exchange method, these amazing agreements can be achieved within a short simulation time (900 ps).

Because phosphorylation contributes a large part of the binding free energy, it has been postulated that electrostatic interactions may play an important role in SH2 domain recognition. To test this hypothesis, we have examined the salt dependence of the interaction between tyrosyl-phosphorylated peptides and SH2 domains. The dependence of the binding constant, Kobs, on [NaCl] was shown to be strong for binding of the tandem SH2 domain of the Syk kinase (Syk-tSH2) to doubly phosphorylated peptides derived from immune-receptor tyrosine activation motifs (dpITAMs):  the slopes of plots of log(Kobs) versus log [NaCl], designated SKobs, ranged from −2.6 ± 0.1 to −3.1 ± 0.2. Binding of the single SH2 domain of the Src kinase to its consensus singly phosphorylated peptide (sequence pYEEI where pY indicates a phosphotyrosine) was also highly dependent on [NaCl] with a SKobs value of −2.4 ± 0.1. The ability of salt to disrupt the interactions between Syk-tSH2 and dpITAM peptides was shown to be anion-dependent with the inhibitory effect following the order:  phosphate > Cl- > F-. For the Syk-tSH2 system, interactions in the pY-binding pockets were shown to be responsible for a large portion of the total salt dependence:  removal of either phosphate from the dpITAM peptide reduced the magnitude of SKobs by 40−60\% and weakened binding by 2−3 orders of magnitude. Consistent with this finding, binding of the single amino acid Ac-pY-NH2 was characterized by a large salt dependence of binding and was also dependent on the identity of the perturbing anion. The role of peptide residues C-terminal to the pY, which are implicated in determining the specificity of the phosphopeptide−SH2 domain interaction, was next probed by comparing the binding of the Src SH2 domain to a peptide containing the pYEEI sequence with that of a lower affinity variant pYAAI peptide:  the magnitude of SKobs for the variant peptide was reduced to −1.3 ± 0.1 as compared to −2.4 ± 0.1 for the pYEEI peptide, indicating that in addition to pY, residues conferring peptide binding specificity contribute significantly to the salt dependence of SH2 domain binding.

However, the motions of mobile counterions are notably slow to converge in MD on DNA. Obtaining accurate and reliable MD simulations requires knowing just how much sampling is required for convergence of each of the properties of interest. To address this issue, MD on a d(CGCGAATTCGCG) duplex in a dilute aqueous solution of water and 22 Na+ counterions was performed until convergence was achieved. The calculated first shell ion occupancies and DNA–Na+ radial distribution functions were computed as a function of time to assess convergence, and compared with relaxation times of the DNA internal parameters shift, slide, rise, tilt, roll, and twist. The sequence dependence of fractional occupancies of ions in the major and minor grooves of the DNA is examined, and the possibility of correlation between ion proximity and DNA minor groove widths is investigated.}},

Water has been modeled with the extended simple point charge model (SPC/E), ions with the Tosi-Fumi model and the interaction between water and ions with the Smith-Dang model. The chemical potential of the solute in the solution has been computed as the derivative of the total free energy with respect to the number of solute particles. The chemical potential of the solute in the solid phase has been calculated by thermodynamic integration to an Einstein crystal. The solubility of the salt has been calculated as the concentration at which the chemical potential of the salt in the solution becomes identical to that of the pure solid. The methodology used in this work has been tested by reproducing the results for the solubility of KF determined previously by Ferrario et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 117, 4947 (2002)]. For KF, it was found that the solubility of the model is only in qualitative agreement with experiment. The variation of the solubility with temperature for KF has also been studied. For NaCl, the potential model used predicts a solubility in good agreement with the experimental value. The same is true for the hydration chemical potential at infinite dilution. Given the practical importance of solutions of NaCl in water the model used in this work, whereas simple, can be of interest for future studies.}},

@article{Chang2015Osmotic,
    abstract = {{The thermodynamic properties of polyelectrolyte solutions are of long-standing interest. Theoretical complexity arises not only from the long-ranged electrostatic interaction but also from the multicomponent nature of the solution, In this work, we report grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations for the effect of added salt on the osmotic pressure of a primitive model of polyelectrolyte solutions. The polymer chains are freely jointed charged hard spheres, and counterions and co-ions are charged hard spheres. We use an ensemble that allows us to calculate directly the osmotic pressure for a solution in equilibrium with a bulk salt solution. As the bulk salt concentration is increased, the concentration of salt in the polyelectrolyte solution decreases and for semidilute solutions the salt concentration is very low. In dilute solution, the salt contribution to the osmotic pressure arises from electrostatic screening and excluded volume interactions. Semidilute solutions behave like salt-free solutions. The simulations show that both polymer molecules and small ions make a significant contribution to the osmotic pressure, thus questioning theories that ignore the polymer contribution. The latter effect results in the decrease in magnitude and a strong concentration dependence of the osmotic pressure. The simulation results are in qualitative accord with experiments on DNA. Scaling theories for the osmotic pressure, however, are not in agreement with the simulations or experiments.}},

@article{Rocklin2013Calculating,
    abstract = {{The calculation of a protein-ligand binding free energy based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations generally relies on a thermodynamic cycle in which the ligand is alchemically inserted into the system, both in the solvated protein and free in solution. The corresponding ligand-insertion free energies are typically calculated in nanoscale computational boxes simulated under periodic boundary conditions and considering electrostatic interactions defined by a periodic lattice-sum. This is distinct from the ideal bulk situation of a system of macroscopic size simulated under non-periodic boundary conditions with Coulombic electrostatic interactions. This discrepancy results in finite-size effects, which affect primarily the charging component of the insertion free energy, are dependent on the box size, and can be large when the ligand bears a net charge, especially if the protein is charged as well. This article investigates finite-size effects on calculated charging free energies using as a test case the binding of the ligand 2-amino-5-methylthiazole (net charge +1 e) to a mutant form of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase in water. Considering different charge isoforms of the protein (net charges −5, 0, +3, or +9 e), either in the absence or the presence of neutralizing counter-ions, and sizes of the cubic computational box (edges ranging from 7.42 to 11.02 nm), the potentially large magnitude of finite-size effects on the raw charging free energies (up to 17.1 kJ mol−1) is demonstrated. Two correction schemes are then proposed to eliminate these effects, a numerical and an analytical one. Both schemes are based on a continuum-electrostatics analysis and require performing Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) calculations on the protein-ligand system. While the numerical scheme requires PB calculations under both non-periodic and periodic boundary conditions, the latter at the box size considered in the MD simulations, the analytical scheme only requires three non-periodic PB calculations for a given system, its dependence on the box size being analytical. The latter scheme also provides insight into the physical origin of the finite-size effects. These two schemes also encompass a correction for discrete solvent effects that persists even in the limit of infinite box sizes. Application of either scheme essentially eliminates the size dependence of the corrected charging free energies (maximal deviation of 1.5 kJ mol−1). Because it is simple to apply, the analytical correction scheme offers a general solution to the problem of finite-size effects in free-energy calculations involving charged solutes, as encountered in calculations concerning, e.g., protein-ligand binding, biomolecular association, residue mutation, pKa and redox potential estimation, substrate transformation, solvation, and solvent-solvent partitioning.}},

@article{Lisal2005Molecular,
    abstract = {{We have developed a molecular-level simulation technique called the expanded-ensemble osmotic molecular dynamics (EEOMD) method, for studying electrolyte solution systems. The EEOMD method performs simulations at a fixed number of solvent molecules, pressure, temperature, and overall electrolyte chemical potential. The method combines elements of constant pressure−constant temperature molecular dynamics and expanded-ensemble grand canonical Monte Carlo. The simulated electrolyte solution systems contain, in addition to solvent molecules, full and fractional ions and undissociated electrolyte molecular units. The fractional particles are coupled to the system via a coupling parameter that varies between 0 (no interaction between the fractional particle and the other particles in the system) and 1 (full interaction between the fractional particle and the other particles in the system). The time evolution of the system is governed by the constant pressure−constant temperature equations of motion and accompanied by random changes in the coupling parameter. The coupling-parameter changes are accepted with a probability derived from the expanded-ensemble osmotic partition function corresponding to the prescribed electrolyte chemical potential. The coupling-parameter changes mimic insertion/deletion of particles as in a crude grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation; if the coupling parameter becomes 0, the fractional particles disappear from the system, and as the coupling parameter reaches unity, the fractional particles become full particles. The method is demonstrated for a model of NaCl in water at ambient conditions. To test our approach, we first determine the chemical potential of NaCl in water by the thermodynamic integration technique and by the expanded-ensemble method. Then, we carry out EEOMD simulations for different specified values of the overall NaCl chemical potential and measure the concentration of ions resulting from the simulations. Both computations give consistent results, validating the EEOMD methodology.}},

    abstract = {{Hybrid algorithms combining nonequilibrium molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo (neMD/MC) offer a powerful avenue for improving the sampling efficiency of computer simulations of complex systems. These neMD/MC algorithms are also increasingly finding use in applications where conventional approaches are impractical, such as constant-pH simulations with explicit solvent. However, selecting an optimal nonequilibrium protocol for maximum efficiency often represents a non-trivial challenge. This work evaluates the efficiency of a broad class of neMD/MC algorithms and protocols within the theoretical framework of linear response theory. The approximations are validated against constant pH-MD simulations and shown to provide accurate predictions of neMD/MC performance. An assessment of a large set of protocols confirms (both theoretically and empirically) that a linear work protocol gives the best neMD/MC performance. Finally, a well-defined criterion for optimizing the time parameters of the protocol is proposed and demonstrated with an adaptive algorithm that improves the performance on-the-fly with minimal cost.}},

    abstract = {{Cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domains are found in >4,000 proteins in species from all kingdoms of life, yet their functions are largely unknown. Tandem CBS domains are associated with membrane transport proteins, most notably members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily; voltage-gated chloride channels and transporters; cation efflux systems; and various enzymes, transcription factors, and proteins of unknown function. We now show that tandem CBS domains in the osmoregulatory ABC transporter OpuA are sensors for ionic strength that control the transport activity through an electrostatic switching mechanism. The on/off state of the transporter is determined by the surface charge of the membrane and the internal ionic strength that is sensed by the CBS domains. By modifying the CBS domains, we can control the ionic strength dependence of the transporter: deleting a stretch of C-terminal anionic residues shifts the ionic strength dependence to higher values, whereas deleting the CBS domains makes the system largely independent of ionic strength. We present a model for the gating of membrane transport by ionic strength and propose a new role for CBS domains.}},

@article{Eil2016Ionic,
    abstract = {{Tumours progress despite being infiltrated by tumour-specific effector T cells. Tumours contain areas of cellular necrosis, which are associated with poor survival in a variety of cancers. Here, we show that necrosis releases intracellular potassium ions into the extracellular fluid of mouse and human tumours, causing profound suppression of T cell effector function. Elevation of the extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]e) impairs T cell receptor (TCR)-driven Akt\&\#19;mTOR phosphorylation and effector programmes. Potassium-mediated suppression of Akt\&\#19;mTOR signalling and T cell function is dependent upon the activity of the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A. Although the suppressive effect mediated by elevated [K+]e is independent of changes in plasma membrane potential (Vm), it requires an increase in intracellular potassium ([K+]i). Accordingly, augmenting potassium efflux in tumour-specific T cells by overexpressing the potassium channel Kv1.3 lowers [K+]i and improves effector functions in vitro and in vivo and enhances tumour clearance and survival in melanoma-bearing mice. These results uncover an ionic checkpoint that blocks T cell function in tumours and identify potential new strategies for cancer immunotherapy.}},

Additionally, ISIM leverages the APBS software package to provide accurate descriptions of the biomolecular electrostatic potential through the efficient solution of Poisson's equation.

Estimation of the binding affinity in this way is routinely performed in  ” favorable” conditions for macromolecules. Crucial data for ligand–protein binding elucidation is mainly derived from techniques (e.g., macromolecular crystallography) that require the addition of high concentration of salts and/or other additives. In this study we have evaluated the effect of temperature, ionic strength, viscosity, and hydrophobicity on the Kd of three previously characterized protein–ligand systems, based on variation in their binding sites, in order to provide insight into how these often overlooked unconventional circumstances impact binding affinity. Our conclusions are as follows: (1) increasing solvent viscosity in general is detrimental to ligand binding, (2) moderate increases in temperature have marginal effects on the dissociation constant, and (3) the degree of hydrophobicity of the ligand and the binding site determines the extent of the influence of cosolvents and salt concentration on ligand binding affinity.}},

Although they differ in morphology, the two forms are often treated indiscriminately. β(2)-microglobulin (β2m), a protein responsible for dialysis-related amyloidosis, forms amyloid fibrils or amorphous aggregates depending on the NaCl concentration at pH 2.5. We compared the kinetics of their formation, which was monitored by measuring thioflavin T fluorescence, light scattering, and 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate fluorescence. Thioflavin T fluorescence specifically monitors amyloid fibrillation, whereas light scattering and 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate fluorescence monitor both amyloid fibrillation and amorphous aggregation. The amyloid fibrils formed via a nucleation-dependent mechanism in a supersaturated solution, analogous to crystallization. The lag phase of fibrillation was reduced upon agitation with stirring or ultrasonic irradiation, and disappeared by seeding with preformed fibrils. In contrast, the glass-like amorphous aggregates formed rapidly without a lag phase. Neither agitation nor seeding accelerated the amorphous aggregation. Thus, by monitoring the kinetics, we can distinguish between crystal-like amyloid fibrils and glass-like amorphous aggregates. Solubility and supersaturation will be key factors for further understanding the aberrant aggregation of proteins.}},

@article{Hill2011Spatial,
    abstract = {{Formation of large protein fibrils with a characteristic cross β-sheet architecture is the key indicator for a wide variety of systemic and neurodegenerative amyloid diseases. Recent experiments have strongly implicated oligomeric intermediates, transiently formed during fibril assembly, as critical contributors to cellular toxicity in amyloid diseases. At the same time, amyloid fibril assembly can proceed along different assembly pathways that might or might not involve such oligomeric intermediates. Elucidating the mechanisms that determine whether fibril formation proceeds along non-oligomeric or oligomeric pathways, therefore, is important not just for understanding amyloid fibril assembly at the molecular level but also for developing new targets for intervening with fibril formation. We have investigated fibril formation by hen egg white lysozyme, an enzyme for which human variants underlie non-neuropathic amyloidosis. Using a combination of static and dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy and circular dichroism, we find that amyloidogenic lysozyme monomers switch between three different assembly pathways: from monomeric to oligomeric fibril assembly and, eventually, disordered precipitation as the ionic strength of the solution increases. Fibril assembly only occurred under conditions of net repulsion among the amyloidogenic monomers while net attraction caused precipitation. The transition from monomeric to oligomeric fibril assembly, in turn, occurred as salt-mediated charge screening reduced repulsion among individual charged residues on the same monomer. We suggest a model of amyloid fibril formation in which repulsive charge interactions are a prerequisite for ordered fibril assembly. Furthermore, the spatial extent of non-specific charge screening selects between monomeric and oligomeric assembly pathways by affecting which subset of denatured states can form suitable intermolecular bonds and by altering the energetic and entropic requirements for the initial intermediates emerging along the monomeric vs. oligomeric assembly path.}},

In the comparison of the stability between wild type and a mutant lysozyme, the difference in pH titration curve between them could be expressed as a two-state process involving protonation of a single acidic residue. The results strongly indicated that the Aune and Tanford theory of protein denaturation [Aune, K.C. and Tanford, C. (1969) Biochemistry 8, 4579-4585] is applicable to protein stability in solution. On the other hand, the pKa values of acidic residues in the presence of low (5 mM) or high (400 mM) salt concentration were determined by means of two-dimensional NMR. We found that the pKa values obtained from the pH dependency of stability were close to those from the NMR experiment under the high salt condition. Moreover, by comparing pKa values at high salt and low salt concentrations, we could evaluate the dependency of two electrostatic interactions (salt bridge and charge-helix dipole interaction) on salt concentration.}},

After accounting for the effects of protein interaction and for changes in solution viscosity on protein diffusivity, protein hydrodynamic radii were determined with +/-0.25 A resolution. No changes to the extent of lysozyme hydration were discernible for all salt-types, at any salt concentration and for temperatures between 15-40 degrees C. Combining static with dynamic light scattering, we also investigated salt-induced changes to the hydrodynamic protein interactions. With increased salt concentration, hydrodynamic interactions changed from attractive to repulsive, i.e., in exact opposition to salt-induced changes in direct protein interactions. This anti-correlation was independent of solution temperature or salt identity. Although salt-specific effects on direct protein interactions were prominent, neither protein hydration nor solvent-mediated hydrodynamic interactions displayed any obvious salt-specific effects. We infer that the protein hydration shell is more resistant than bulk water to changes in its local structure by either chaotropic or kosmotropic ions.}},

@article{Joung2008Determination,
    abstract = {{Alkali (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) and halide (F−, Cl−, Br−, and I−) ions play an important role in many biological phenomena, roles that range from stabilization of biomolecular structure, to influence on biomolecular dynamics, to key physiological influence on homeostasis and signaling. To properly model ionic interaction and stability in atomistic simulations of biomolecular structure, dynamics, folding, catalysis, and function, an accurate model or representation of the monovalent ions is critically necessary. A good model needs to simultaneously reproduce many properties of ions, including their structure, dynamics, solvation, and moreover both the interactions of these ions with each other in the crystal and in solution and the interactions of ions with other molecules. At present, the best force fields for biomolecules employ a simple additive, nonpolarizable, and pairwise potential for atomic interaction. In this work, we describe our efforts to build better models of the monovalent ions within the pairwise Coulombic and 6-12 Lennard-Jones framework, where the models are tuned to balance crystal and solution properties in Ewald simulations with specific choices of well-known water models. Although it has been clearly demonstrated that truly accurate treatments of ions will require inclusion of nonadditivity and polarizability (particularly with the anions) and ultimately even a quantum mechanical treatment, our goal was to simply push the limits of the additive treatments to see if a balanced model could be created. The applied methodology is general and can be extended to other ions and to polarizable force-field models. Our starting point centered on observations from long simulations of biomolecules in salt solution with the AMBER force fields where salt crystals formed well below their solubility limit. The likely cause of the artifact in the AMBER parameters relates to the naive mixing of the Smith and Dang chloride parameters with AMBER-adapted \AA{}qvist cation parameters. To provide a more appropriate balance, we reoptimized the parameters of the Lennard-Jones potential for the ions and specific choices of water models. To validate and optimize the parameters, we calculated hydration free energies of the solvated ions and also lattice energies (LE) and lattice constants (LC) of alkali halide salt crystals. This is the first effort that systematically scans across the Lennard-Jones space (well depth and radius) while balancing ion properties like LE and LC across all pair combinations of the alkali ions and halide ions. The optimization across the entire monovalent series avoids systematic deviations. The ion parameters developed, optimized, and characterized were targeted for use with some of the most commonly used rigid and nonpolarizable water models, specifically TIP3P, TIP4PEW, and SPC/E. In addition to well reproducing the solution and crystal properties, the new ion parameters well reproduce binding energies of the ions to water and the radii of the first hydration shells.}},

@article{Nguyen2016Extracting,
    abstract = {{Small-angle X-ray scattering measurements can provide valuable information about the solvent environment around biomolecules, but it can be difficult to extract solvent-specific information from observed intensity profiles. Intensities are proportional to the square of scattering amplitudes, which are complex quantities. Amplitudes in the forward direction are real, and the contribution from a solute of known structure (and from the waters it excludes) can be estimated from theory; hence, the amplitude arising from the solvent environment can be computed by difference. We have found that this  ” square root subtraction scheme” can be extended to non-zero q values, out to 0.1 \AA{}−1 for the systems considered here, since the phases arising from the solute and from the water environment are nearly identical in this angle range. This allows us to extract aspects of the water and ion distributions (beyond their total numbers), by combining experimental data for the complete system with calculations for the solutes. We use this approach to test molecular dynamics and integral-equation (3D-RISM (three-dimensional reference interaction site model)) models for solvent structure around myoglobin, lysozyme, and a 25 base-pair duplex DNA. Comparisons can be made both in Fourier space and in terms of the distribution of interatomic distances in real space. Generally, computed solvent distributions arising from the MD simulations fit experimental data better than those from 3D-RISM, even though the total small-angle X-ray scattering patterns are very similar; this illustrates the potential power of this sort of analysis to guide the development of computational models.}},

@article{Salis2014Models,
    abstract = {{Specific effects of electrolytes have posed a challenge since the 1880's. The pioneering work was that of Franz Hofmeister who studied specific salt induced protein precipitation. These effects are the rule rather the exception and are ubiquitous in chemistry and biology. Conventional electrostatic theories (Debye-Huckel, DLVO, etc.) cannot explain such effects. Over the past decades it has been recognised that additional quantum mechanical dispersion forces with associated hydration effects acting on ions are missing from theory. In parallel Collins has proposed a phenomenological set of rules (the law of matching water affinities, LMWA) which explain and bring to order the order of ion-ion and ion-surface site interactions at a qualitative level. The two approaches appear to conflict. Although the need for inclusion of quantum dispersion forces in one form or another is not questioned, the modelling has often been misleading and inappropriate. It does not properly describe the chemical nature (kosmotropic/chaotropic or hard/soft) of the interacting species. The success of the LMWA rules lies in the fact that they do. Here we point to the way that the two apparently opposing approaches might be reconciled. Notwithstanding, there are more challenges, which deal with the effect of dissolved gas and its connection to 'hydrophobic' interactions, the problem of water at different temperatures and 'water structure' in the presence of solutes. They take us to another dimension that requires the rebuilding of theoretical foundations.}},

@article{Wright2002Effect,
    abstract = {{The extremely halophilic Archae require near-saturating concentrations of salt in the external environment and in their cytoplasm, potassium being the predominant intracellular cation. The proteins of these organisms have evolved to function in concentrations of salt that inactivate or precipitate homologous proteins from non-halophilic species. It has been proposed that haloadaptation is primarily due to clustering of acidic residues on the surface of the protein, and that these clusters bind networks of hydrated ions. The dihydrofolate reductases from Escherichia coli (ecDHFR) and two DHFR isozymes from Haloferax volcanii (hvDHFR1 and hvDHFR2) have been used as a model system to compare the effect of salts on a mesophilic and halophilic enzyme. The KCl-dependence of the activity and substrate affinity was investigated. ecDHFR is largely inactivated above 1 M KCl, with no major effect on substrate affinity. hvDHFR1 and hvDHFR2 unfold at KCl concentrations below ∼0.5 M. Above ∼1 M, the KCl dependence of the hvDHFR activities can be attributed to the effect of salt on substrate affinity. The abilities of NaCl, KCl, and CsCl to enhance the stability to urea denaturation were determined, and similar efficacies of stabilization were observed for all three DHFR variants. The \^{I}G°(H2O) values increased linearly with increasing KCl and CsCl concentrations. The increase of \^{I}G°(H2O) as a function of the smallest cation, NaCl, is slightly curved, suggesting a minor stabilization from cation binding or screening of electrostatic repulsion. At their respective physiological ionic strengths, the DHFR variants exhibit similar stabilities. Salts stabilize ecDHFR and the hvDHFRs by a common mechanism, not a halophile-specific mechanism, such as the binding of hydrated salt networks. The primary mode of salt stabilization of the mesophilic and halophilic DHFRs appears to be through preferential hydration and the Hofmeister effect of salt on the activity and entropy of the aqueous solvent. In support of this conclusion, all three DHFRs are similarly stabilized by the non-ionic cosolute, sucrose.}},

@article{Spencer2005Effects,
    abstract = {{Environmental variables can exert significant influences on the folding stability of a protein, and elucidating these influences provides insight on the determinants of protein stability. Here, experimental data on the stability of FKBP12 are reported for the effects of three environmental variables: pH, salt, and macromolecular crowding. In the pH range of 5–9, contribution to the pH dependence of the unfolding free energy from residual charge–charge interactions in the unfolded state was found to be negligible. The negligible contribution was attributed to the lack of sequentially nearest neighboring charged residues around groups that titrate in the pH range. KCl lowered the stability of FKBP12 and the E31Q/D32N double mutant at small salt concentrations but raised stability after ∼0.5 M salt. Such a turnover behavior was accounted for by the balance of two opposing types of protein–salt interactions: the Debye–H\"{u}ckel type, modeling the response of the ions to protein charges, favors the unfolded state while the Kirkwood type, accounting for the disadvantage of the ions moving toward the low-dielectric protein cavity from the bulk solvent, disfavors the unfolded state. Ficoll 70 as a crowding agent was found to have a modest effect on protein stability, in qualitative agreement with a simple model suggesting that the folded and unfolded states are nearly equally adversely affected by macromolecular crowding. For any environmental variable, it is the balance of its effects on the folded and unfolded states that determines the outcome on the folding stability.}},

@article{Paluch2008Comparing,
    abstract = {{We present results from a computational study investigating the use of Gibbs ensemble and grand-canonical transition-matrix Monte Carlo (GC-TMMC) methods to determine the liquid−vapor phase coexistence properties of pure molecular fluids of varying degrees of complexity. The molecules used in this study were ethane, n-octane, cyclohexane, 2,5-dimethylhexane, 1-propanol, and water. We first show that the GC-TMMC method can reproduce Gibbs ensemble results found in the literature. Given the excellent agreement for each molecule, we then compare directly the performance of Gibbs ensemble and GC-TMMC simulations at both low and high reduced temperatures by monitoring the relative uncertainties in the saturation properties as a function of computational time. In general, we found that the GC-TMMC method yielded limiting uncertainties in the saturated vapor density and pressure that were significantly smaller, by an order of magnitude in some instances, than those of the Gibbs ensemble method. Limiting Gibbs ensemble uncertainties for these properties were generally in the 0.8−5.0\% range. However, both methods yielded comparable limiting uncertainties in the saturated liquid density, which fell within the range of 0.1−1.0\%. In the case of water at 300 K, we found that the Gibbs ensemble outperformed GC-TMMC. The relatively poor performance of the GC-TMMC method in this situation was tied to the slow convergence of the density probability distribution at this low temperature. We also discuss strategies for improving the convergence rate under these conditions.}},
